# MLOPs-Assessment-MentalHealthRisk

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end **MLOps system** that supports the full machine learning lifecycle â€” from training to deployment and monitoring â€” with deployments to both **virtual machines (VMs)** and **Kubernetes clusters via Minikube**.

## ðŸ“Œ Branching Strategy

- **FB**: Feature Branch  
- **RB**: Release Branch  
- PRs flow: `FB` â†’ `RB-*` â†’ `dev` â†’ `main`  
- Deployments:
  - Dev environment: on merge to `dev`
  - Prod environment: on merge to `main`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Workflow Strategy

### ðŸ›  Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **CI**: Triggered on push to any feature branch and on PRs to `dev` and `main`
- **CD**:
  - Deploy to **dev** on merge to `dev`
  - Deploy to **prod** via manual promotion (e.g., `promote_docker_image.yml`)
